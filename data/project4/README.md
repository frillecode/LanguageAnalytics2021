### Data folder for project 4

For this assignment, I used pretrained word embeddings from ```GloVe```. To run the script, these needs to be downloaded and placed in the data-folder as well. This can be done by running the following in the command-line:
```bash
$ cd LanguageAnalytics2021/data/project4/glove
$ wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
$ unzip -q glove.6B.zip
```
