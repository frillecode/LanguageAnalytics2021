### Data folder for project 4
The data for this assignment can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/albenft/game-of-thrones-script-all-seasons, and should be placed in this data-folder. 

For this assignment, I used pretrained word embeddings from ```GloVe```. To run the script, these needs to be downloaded and placed in the data-folder as well. This can be done by running the following in the command-line:
```bash
$ cd CDS-spring-2021-language/data/project4/glove
$ wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
$ unzip -q glove.6B.zip
```
