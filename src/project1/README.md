The script runs on a sample of 100000 from the original data set to save computationl power. This must be taken into account when making inferences from the plots. From the two plots, we see that the the window size (weekly/monthly) for the rolling average makes a difference for the interpreting the results. In general, the daily average sentiment scores seem to fluctuate around 0.02. From the 7-days rolling average, we see daily fluctuations and a small general increase from around 2014. From the 30-days rolling average, fewer local fluctuations appear, however, we see the changes over time more clearly. Here, the average sentiment seems to decrease from 2004-2012 followed by an increase from 2012 peaking in 2016 from where the average sentiment decreases again.
